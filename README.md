## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and is titled "Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist." It consists of extensive e-commerce data from the Olist platform, capturing customer information, order transactions, product reviews, and other activities. The dataset provides insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and more.

### Dataset Highlights:
- **Customer Information:** Personal details and segmentation
- **Order History:** Purchase records and order tracking
- **Transactional Data:** Payments and shipping information
- **Product Reviews and Ratings:** Feedback and satisfaction metrics
